# Health-Score-Calculator
Health Score Calculator for anyone, any company or organisation who want to know or keep track of the health status of their employees. The idea is to get all the important individual information that is directly and indirectly correlated with health, then apply an algorithm to the information which will help to predict or score the individual. This is usually done by the doctors manually, by looking at all the individuals vitals, x-rays, ecgs, blood tests and so forth. So the idea is to automate this process. The individual has to go through all the tests then input all his important information into the database. The algorithm will then be applied to the individual data in order to give a Health Score.

# This project is in the early stages, so this is just the input page that is connected to the database.
